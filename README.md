# Administrative divisions of Serbia

A single geopackapge file containing adminstrative units in Serbia obtained from OpenStreetMap. Level 6 represent districts (okruzi) which are centers of state authority, but they don't have their own assemblies. Levels 7 and 8 represent municipalities (opštine) and cities (gradovi) respectively. Municipalities are basic entities of local governments in Serbia. There are two types of muncipalities: regular and city municipalities. The city may or may not be divided into city municipalities.
